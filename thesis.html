                        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">&emsp; &emsp; In 2020, I completed my Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of New Brunswick Fredericton, and decided to
                        move further with my education into a Master's degree. While I had initially planned to finish my Bachelor's degree and begin a career in front-end development, a class with my
                        would be supervisor (Dr. Scott Bateman) changed my mind. Since I was a kid, I always had an intrest in not only video games, but in the development process behind them. I can remember
                        telling my parents that I wanted to be a "game tester" as my first career aspiration in kindergarden.</p>

                    <div style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10%;"> 
                        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">&emsp; &emsp; In 2020 I began my Master's degree at UNBF with an intended focus of studying asymmetry in games &#40;asymmetric games being 
                        games where players have different actions and abilities, and symmetric games being games where all players have the same actions and abilities&#41;, and how they affected 
                        overall player experience. With this in mind, I began my project on exploring the relationship between game symmetry and player experience within competitive games. This particular
                        focus was inspired by the love/hate relationship I have with games such as League of Legends &#40;most who play this game would describe it in a similar fashion&#41;, and how interesting
                        I find the dynamics they create. When looking at asymmetry, I can see so much potential for design space, but so much drawback to its complexity.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">To investigate this, I created a testbed game named <i><a href="https://pathkendle.itch.io/slimeball-demo">Slimeball</a></i> using Unity.
                        In this game, players control different characters all themed around classic fantasy classes &#40;Knight, Wizard, Barbarian&#41;, and hit a ball back and forth to each other like in Pong. Unlike Pong,
                        in <i>Slimeball</i> players have access to three unique abilities defined by their character class which they could use to one-up the other player. I also implemented two gamemodes into <i>Slimeball</i>:
                        Quick Match to represent a symmetric experience and Showdown to represent an asymmetric experience. </p>

                        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;"> Creating <i>Slimeball</i> was a technical challenge as I was still very new to game development and Unity. Furthermore, due to project requirements, the game
                        needed to be playable remotely online. I experimented with several different networking libraries with mixed success (mostly due to lag issues), and landed on Fusion which I used to complete the game. In this process,
                        I was able to experience many different aspects of the game development and design world:
                        <ul style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">
                            <li>I had to design a game that was learnable within a short period of time and was easily understandable to a wide audience.</li>
                            <li>I had to source art for the game, as well as learn the basics of pixel art and 2D animation to create character sprite sheets.</li>
                            <li>I had to source and mix existing sounds, as well as create sound effects.</li>
                            <li>I had to implement the game using Unity, and learn game networking in Fusion and other prospective libraries</li>
                            <li>I had to run playtest groups and collect data to balance the game sufficiently</li>
                        </ul>  </p>
                        <p style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">In the end, I found that asymmetry can have a positive effect on overall player experience, and specifically player autonomy, within competitive settings. I feel through this experience I gained many useful skills
                            that will help my career greatly in the future.</p>
